Idris and Rust related tutorials for umbrela.academy and idri.school


As mentioned before in the course introductions, we will be looking at **TIJKR** languages (Typescript, Idris, Julia, Kotlin, Rust). The last generation of languages that these 5 are succeeding were also not bad - just not good enough anymore.

 - _Javascript_ -> **Typescript**, 
 - _Haskell_ -> **Idris**, 
 - _Python_ -> **Julia**, 
 - _Java_ -> **Kotlin**, 
 - _C/C++_ -> **Rust**
